-----------------
-   T2 ENTRIES  - 
-----------------

  2 item entries containing model data for a game object

-----------

ITEM 1:
-------

0x0: number of polygons
0x4: X scale
0x8: Y scale
0xC: Z scale
0x10: size of texture/color information for polygons
0x14 - 0x14+(count*4): texture/color information for polygons: 

when the highest bit is set, indicating texture information, a structure is of this form:

1PPN0000 RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB ________ ____OOOO OOOOOOOO F__III__ DDDDDDDD DDMMCCXX XXXTTTTT TT_YYYYY
============================================================================================================
  //PP           = primitive type tag
  //N            = flag for allow normal clipping
  //RRRRRRRR     = global red
  //GGGGGGGG     = global green
  //BBBBBBBB     = global blue
  //OOOOOOOOOOOO = color lookup table offset
  //F            = texture coordinates flag
  //DDDDDDDDDD   = index into an array of default values
  //MM           = texture color mode
  //CC           = texture page x ID
  //III          = texture page y ID
  //XXXXX        = texture x coordinates
  //YYYYY        = texture y coordinates
  //TTTTTTT      = color lookup table ID (for modes 0 & 1)  [1 table = 4 palettes]  

when the highest bit is not set, (indicating no texture information), a structure is of this form:

000N0000 RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB
======================================
  //N            = flag for allow normal clipping
  //RRRRRRRR     = global red
  //GGGGGGGG     = global green
  //BBBBBBBB     = global blue


ITEM 2:
--------
2 word structures, each describing a polygon in the model. have the form:

FTTTTTTT TTTTTTTT CCCCCCCC CCCCCCCC BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB AAAAAAAA AAAAAAAA
=============================
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA = VERTEX A
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB = VERTEX B
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC = VERTEX C
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT  = TEXTURE/COLOR INFORMATION
F                = DISPLAY FLAG (if cleared, the vertex wont get sent to the gte after perspective transform?)

-vertex a, b, and c each refer to an offset into this entry's corresponding T1 entry from index 0x38:
-texture color information refers to an offset into this entry's ITEM 1 from index 0x14
-F flag determines what type of primitive will be dedicated to the polygon when sending it to the GPU
(textured or non-textured)
